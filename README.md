This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: improper handling of null or undefined values. The `foo` function adds two numbers, but it doesn't explicitly check for null or undefined input. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors.  The solution demonstrates how to properly handle these cases to improve robustness and prevent runtime issues.
